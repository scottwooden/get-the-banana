Get The Banana
===============

"Get the Banana" is a weekend hackathon project created at ArtHackathon. Created by Chris Brown & Scott Wooden. 

The Game
--------
In brief it's a wikipedia powered word association game. The objective is to get to the Wikipedia page Banana by typing in related links that would lead you closer to that page. It's based around the popular wiki game of getting from one page to another in the fewest number of clicks through the articles links.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game for more details on the original concept.

The gameplay involves starting wit a randomly assigned start word. You then type in a word that you think would be on that page that would lead you to the next, while having in mind a core goal of getting to the page banana.

EG.
Earth -> Plants -> Fruit -> Banana

Each word is a respective wiki page with links that take you to the next. Thus you'd get to banana!


Feel free to play with the code, bearing in mind it was a messy hack! Some ideas to further improve this game:

-	Adding a multiplayer mode between two computers
-	Adding difficulty modes. Harder more obscure words mean more thought and longer chains.
-	Sharing ability. Tweeting / Facebooking scores etc.

Okay that's all don't forget to share what you make of it! :)
